The purpose of these two interfaces is to connect to the USB of the controlled computer, used to control the mouse and keyboard. At the same time, only one interface can be used. The purpose of designing two interfaces is to directly use USB PC2 when the user's PC host has a row pin USB interface, which will make the wiring more concise. POWER-IN When using PoE power supply, there is no need to connect the PWR-IN port. When not using PoE power supply, connect the PWR-IN port to a standard 5V/3A USB power supply. ETHERNET-PoE Gigabit Ethernet port Standard: IEEE 802.3af PoE Input voltage: 37-57 V DC Output power: 5 V DC/2.4 A ATX-Connecter Connect to power control interface on the motherboard of the controlled computer with DuPont cables. It can turn on, off, and restart the controlled computer. The pin is defined on the printing of the PCIe board, BTN means button. According to the instructions of the computer motherboard, first find the position of the ATX function related pins on the motherboard, and then unplug the ATX ray that has been connected to the motherboard. After unplugging, the power button of the computer will lose its function. There are two rows of 8PIN pins on the PCIe board. It is unnecessary to distinguish between the two rows of pins when they are used with the same functions. One row of pins is used for KVM to control ATX-related functions, and the other row of pins is connected to the ATX DuPont head unplugged from the main board to maintain the original chassis power button function. Connect each wire according to the specific pin definitions on the motherboard and PCIe.

The default baud rate is 115200. There is an onboard CH341-based USB to UART converter present inside BliKVM v4 which is connected to UART0 of the mCore-H616 SoC , so you can connect a USB port of a PC to the 5V port without an external UART and a USB-C to dupont adapter. PC USB port current output Be careful when trying to use the 5V port because a PC USB port alone may not be able to provide 3A (5V) which is a documented requirement for the board to work. Either use a 12V 2A DC port at the same time as using the 5V port for serial communication without a USB Splitter board, or use the splitter board to split out the VCC pin and use a separate 5V 3A power supply to provide power to the 5V port's VCC pin. Likewise, when disconnecting a cable from the 12V 2A DC port while BliKVM is powered on, make sure to disconnect the cable from the 5V port first (because that will become the power source for BliKVM v4 after the 12V 2A source is disconnected unless a splitter is used).

B-board The b-board has an adapted full-height and half-height metal PCI mounting plate, which can be installed on the computer case. The user connects the pins on the B-board to the ATX control interface on the computer motherboard using the color DuPont cables provided with the product. ATXA-B Instructions for connecting to the computer motherboard According to the instructions of the computer motherboard, first find the position of the ATX function related pins on the motherboard, and then unplug the ATX ray that has been connected to the motherboard. After unplugging, the power button of the computer will lose its function. There are two rows of 8PIN pins on the ATXA-B motherboard. It is unnecessary to distinguish between the two rows of pins when they are used with the same functions. One row of pins is used for KVM to control ATX-related functions, and the other row of pins is connected to the ATX DuPont head unplugged from the main board to maintain the original chassis power button function. Connect each wire according to the specific pin definitions on the motherboard and ATXA-B. See the following figure for the connection relationship\uff1a 4.Mechanical Diagram 5.

There is a female-to-female cable that connects from the motherboard to the ATX control board and a male-to-female cable that connects from the ATX control board to the front panel (to keep the power on/off button on the chassis functional). The interface on the ATX control board has two ports (TO CASE, TO MB), and both ports have the same functionality, so they can be used interchangeably. ATX compatibility Laptops are not compatible with ATX as they lack the required ATX pins. This method is only applicable to Desktop PC's and servers. Detailed Instructions 1. Connect the two cables to the ATX control board. To secure the ATX control board inside the chassis, you can choose to mount it on a bracket attached to a PCIe slot. Example 2. Locate the motherboard pins responsible for connecting the front panel buttons and LEDs and disconnect them. Usually, the cables and connectors on the motherboard are labeled. If you're unsure, you can refer to your motherboard's documentation. Example 3. Connect the DuPont male connector from the front panel to the DuPont female connector on the ATX cable, following the pin definitions and paying attention to the labels and polarity (+ or -). Example 4. Using the same method, connect the female pins from the ATX board to the corresponding connector on the motherboard. Refer to your motherboard's documentation to determine which pins on the motherboard connect to which pins on the ATX control board. Sometimes, this information is printed on the motherboard. Example 5. Install the ATX board into a PCI slot on the chassis and secure it with screws or use alternative mounting methods according to your preference. Example 6. Arrange the cables neatly and secure them as needed. Make sure the cables do not come into contact with any fans inside the chassis.

Most steps to successfully set up your BLIKVM are already described there. If you run into any issues you can check this page which will list common errors. If that still doesn't help you you're welcome to raise an issue ticket or join our Discord for further help. Common Questions Can I connect multiple servers to a single BLIKVM? Yes, but it requires additional work to set up. See this page . How can I get the access to PiKVM in my local network over Internet? If your router has an external IP address, you can use port forwarding to forward port 80 (Web), port 8008 (mjpeg), and port 8188 (webrtc) In all other cases, you can use the excellent free VPN service Tailscale. Which BLiKVM hardware version should I choose, such as BLiKVM V1 CM4, BLiKVM V2 PCIe, and BLiKVM V3 Hat? First, please refer to this page for a comparison of the main parameters of each version. V1 and V3 are external solutions, while V2 is an internal chassis solution. If you have a chassis and there is space inside, choosing the V2 PCIe version would be a better option. So how do you choose between the external solutions V1 and V3? V1 is based on the CM4 platform, with higher integration and ready-to-use versions available. V3 is based on the Raspberry Pi 4B platform, with all IO ports exposed and greater expandability. Another key difference is that V1 supports up to 1080P60Hz input, while V3 supports up to 1080P50Hz input. Of course, you also need to consider whether you already have a CM4 or 4B, as purchasing the corresponding baseboard would offer better cost-effectiveness. Can I use BLIKVM for gaming? No, because: For HDMI-CSI bridge, bus bandwidth is not enough to transmit more than 1080p60. For HDMI-USB dongle, high latency and low video quality. General hardware video capture differs from software streaming and introduces additional latency. Can BLIKVM do 4K video? For HDMI-CSI bridge, no. There is not enough bandwidth in the CSI bus for that much data. 1080p60 will max out the bandwidth. For the USB capture devices: technically yes, they will downsample to something smaller to meet the USB 2.0 bandwidth limitations, so the source may be 4k, but the stream will not. The 4K real-time video will not fit through the network anyway. Where does the cursor/video latency come from? Here is the chain of transferring an image to your browser or VNC client. Capture device -> Compression -> Network -> Decompression -> Rendering 100-200ms is very, very fast for this. But we are working to speed things up even more. Does BLIKVM support sound? BliKVM v1 CM4, v2 PCIe, v3 HAT version supported\uff0c v4 Allwinner not support now. Can I power the Pi via PoE? Yes! Hat and PCIe version supported. First Steps What is the default password? How do I change it? If you use PiKVM, there are two types of accounts: OS and PiKVM (web interface) accounts. The system account blikvm can be used for SSH/UART access and has the password blikvm . The web interface account is called admin and has the password admin . The PiKVM account cannot be used for SSH access and vice versa. To change passwords, use the following commands (become the root user): su - # If you're in the webterm rw # Switch filesystem to read-write mode passwd blikvm # Change blikvm user password kvmd-htpasswd set admin # Change web ui admin password ro # Back to read-only How do I add another user? If you use PiKVM software, as stated above you need to make 2 accounts, 1 for the shell, the other for the PiKVM Web UI. If you require additional users for PiKVM UI, you can use the following: # su - # rw # kvmd-htpasswd set <user> # Adds a new user # kvmd-htpasswd set <user> # Sets the password as long as the user exists # kvmd-htpasswd del <user> # Removes/deletes a user To add a shell/terminal account: # su - # rw # adduser <user> # passwd <user> Keep in mind that the more users that are added and accessing the screen stream at the same time, the FPS will drop. Video Problems BLIKVM does not show the video from the computer at all If the output of dmesg | grep tc358743 does not show something similar as tc358743 found @ ... , then this means that the TC358743 HDMI input bridge is not detected. Verify that the flex flat cable (ffc) is correctly connected. Double-check that the video capture device is connected correctly. For the CSI bridge, this should be exactly the camera port. Some laptops do not output any signal until you switch the output (usually via the FN + and an F5 key on the keyboard). Your computer may have turned on sleep mode for the monitor. Move the mouse to turn it off. For windows you might need to check for the active signal resolution. To change the active signal resolution you have to go to Settings>System>Display>Advanced display settings>Display adapter properties then, click \"List All Models\" and choose the one you want. Keep trying different Hz settings. The video works in the booted OS, but not in the BIOS/UEFI This problem appears on Intel NUC, GA-H77-DS3H, and some other devices when using a CSI bridge. All you need to do is change the EDID data. This is the information about supported resolutions that the CSI bridge reports to your computer. Glitchy or wrong BIOS/UEFI resolution On some motherboards, the BIOS may be displayed at a lower resolution, or with some rendering issues/glitches, specially on newer ASUS ones. Like this: This can be solved by enabling the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in your BIOS, usually under the Boot options. If you can't or don't want to enable the CSM, you can try connecting a DisplayPort (DP) monitor, or a dummy plug . If you remove the DP cable/adapter the bug will reappear. If none of this works, try connecting the DP cable first, boot into the BIOS, disable the CSM and shutdown (do not restart) your PC. Then, boot into the BIOS and enable the CSM before shutting down your PC. Then connect the HDMI and turn your PC on again. There is no video in GRUB2, but there is before and after Sometimes this can be caused by the specifics of the BIOS/UEFI and how GRUB2 works with video. This can be solved by enabling the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in your BIOS, usually under the Boot options. The video mode will be located in the same section. Switch the Video mode from UEFI to Legacy . No image from computer with Linux + Awesome WM Sometimes Awesome WM on Linux can't recognize a video output change on a cable. That is, if the cable was first inserted into the monitor, and then you reconnected it to BLIKVM - it may happen that you will not see the image. It seems that the problem is Awesome WM, since for example with KDE, it is not reproducable. If you turn on your workstation with BLIKVM already connected, everything will work fine. USB Problems (keyboard, mouse, mass storage, etc) What speed is the USB OTG port? Per the official RPI documentation, this is a limitation of the SoC. The OTG port is only USB2.0, so is limited to 455 Mbit/s. Why can't some keyboard shortcuts of physical keyboards be captured while virtual keyboards can? For example, the F11 key on a Mac computer cannot be captured. This is because some shortcuts are already in use by the system, such as in macOS, where F11 is assigned to the \"Show Desktop\" function by default. When you press F11 in a web interface, the KeyboardEvent is first captured by the system, and if a callback is registered in the system, the event will not be passed to the application. To solve this issue, you can disable the system's assigned shortcut or use a virtual keyboard. Hardware Problems (Wi-Fi, ATX, etc) If you use PiKVM software, the web UI show FAN error! Because the fan model used by BLIKVM hardware is different from that of PIKVM hardware, viewing the fan status through the web interface may fail in the latest system of pikvm. However, this will not affect the normal operation of BLIKVM fan. Therefore, when using the PIKVM image, as long as you ensure that the install script displays OK, it means that the update of the kvmd fan program is successful. The threshold temperature set by the default program is 60 degrees Celsius. When the CPU temperature is detected to exceed 60 degrees Celsius, the fan will start rotating at 85% speed. If you want to modify the threshold temperature and speed, you can modify the kvmd-fan.py script, and then re-execute install.sh. I can't connect to Wi-Fi at all! If your device is unable to connect to the Wi-Fi network that you have set up, check the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channel used by your Wi-Fi access point. If channels 12 to 14 are used (some countries have banned these channels) try to use a channel between 1 and 11. BLIKVM complains about low power warnings Are you using a \"proper\" power supply? Not one you hacked together? Some USB power bricks advertise 5V 2.1A or higher, but can't deliver consistent 5V. Best to use Raspberry Pi Foundation recommended power supplies. It should be 5.1v and 3A DC output. When I use the PoE, do I still need to use the power OTG splitter to prevent back power on the machine usb? Only HAT version you need to use power OTG splitter to prevent back power. Generally, most hosts computer are protected back power, you do not need to usr power OTG splitter in this case. BLIKVM-CM4-V2.2 and BLIKVM-PCIe version don't need. In some board like BLIKVM-PCIe or BLIKVM-CM4-V2.2 has boot pin, how do I connect? If you short them, CM4 will not start normally, but will enter the burning image mode. If your hardware version of boot has only two pins, use the jumper cap to connect the two pins as a short circuit. If you do not use the jumper cap or plug it into one pin, CM4 will start normally. If you use three boot pins of the hardware version, use the jumper cap to connect GND and another non-GND pin to indicate short circuit, and plug the jumper cap on the two GND pins or do not use it, CM4 will start normally. Web Problems What ports does BliKVM OS occupy, and how should it be forwarded when using a public server? The web interface uses the HTTP protocol and occupies port 80. If you are using hardware versions V1, V2, or V3 with web-rtc transmission, the port is 8188. If you are using hardware version V4 with MJPEG transmission, the port is 8008. Please note that the ports cannot be modified; only port forwarding can be configured. Raspberry Problems Can I use both the CM4 version with EMMC and the SD card at the same time? No, you can't, When designing the CM4 hardware, several pins of the SD card are only valid in the lite version. You can find instructions on the official website of Raspberry Pi.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq-troubleshooting","text":"As a first step, we recommend carefully reading our documentation.

Yes, but it requires additional work to set up. See this page . How can I get the access to PiKVM in my local network over Internet? If your router has an external IP address, you can use port forwarding to forward port 80 (Web), port 8008 (mjpeg), and port 8188 (webrtc) In all other cases, you can use the excellent free VPN service Tailscale. Which BLiKVM hardware version should I choose, such as BLiKVM V1 CM4, BLiKVM V2 PCIe, and BLiKVM V3 Hat? First, please refer to this page for a comparison of the main parameters of each version. V1 and V3 are external solutions, while V2 is an internal chassis solution. If you have a chassis and there is space inside, choosing the V2 PCIe version would be a better option. So how do you choose between the external solutions V1 and V3? V1 is based on the CM4 platform, with higher integration and ready-to-use versions available. V3 is based on the Raspberry Pi 4B platform, with all IO ports exposed and greater expandability. Another key difference is that V1 supports up to 1080P60Hz input, while V3 supports up to 1080P50Hz input. Of course, you also need to consider whether you already have a CM4 or 4B, as purchasing the corresponding baseboard would offer better cost-effectiveness. Can I use BLIKVM for gaming? No, because: For HDMI-CSI bridge, bus bandwidth is not enough to transmit more than 1080p60. For HDMI-USB dongle, high latency and low video quality. General hardware video capture differs from software streaming and introduces additional latency. Can BLIKVM do 4K video? For HDMI-CSI bridge, no. There is not enough bandwidth in the CSI bus for that much data. 1080p60 will max out the bandwidth. For the USB capture devices: technically yes, they will downsample to something smaller to meet the USB 2.0 bandwidth limitations, so the source may be 4k, but the stream will not. The 4K real-time video will not fit through the network anyway. Where does the cursor/video latency come from? Here is the chain of transferring an image to your browser or VNC client. Capture device -> Compression -> Network -> Decompression -> Rendering 100-200ms is very, very fast for this. But we are working to speed things up even more. Does BLIKVM support sound? BliKVM v1 CM4, v2 PCIe, v3 HAT version supported\uff0c v4 Allwinner not support now. Can I power the Pi via PoE? Yes! Hat and PCIe version supported.","title":"Common Questions"},{"location":"faq/#first-steps","text":"What is the default password? How do I change it? If you use PiKVM, there are two types of accounts: OS and PiKVM (web interface) accounts. The system account blikvm can be used for SSH/UART access and has the password blikvm . The web interface account is called admin and has the password admin . The PiKVM account cannot be used for SSH access and vice versa. To change passwords, use the following commands (become the root user): su - # If you're in the webterm rw # Switch filesystem to read-write mode passwd blikvm # Change blikvm user password kvmd-htpasswd set admin # Change web ui admin password ro # Back to read-only How do I add another user? If you use PiKVM software, as stated above you need to make 2 accounts, 1 for the shell, the other for the PiKVM Web UI. If you require additional users for PiKVM UI, you can use the following: # su - # rw # kvmd-htpasswd set <user> # Adds a new user # kvmd-htpasswd set <user> # Sets the password as long as the user exists # kvmd-htpasswd del <user> # Removes/deletes a user To add a shell/terminal account: # su - # rw # adduser <user> # passwd <user> Keep in mind that the more users that are added and accessing the screen stream at the same time, the FPS will drop.","title":"First Steps"},{"location":"faq/#video-problems","text":"BLIKVM does not show the video from the computer at all If the output of dmesg | grep tc358743 does not show something similar as tc358743 found @ ... , then this means that the TC358743 HDMI input bridge is not detected. Verify that the flex flat cable (ffc) is correctly connected. Double-check that the video capture device is connected correctly. For the CSI bridge, this should be exactly the camera port. Some laptops do not output any signal until you switch the output (usually via the FN + and an F5 key on the keyboard). Your computer may have turned on sleep mode for the monitor. Move the mouse to turn it off. For windows you might need to check for the active signal resolution. To change the active signal resolution you have to go to Settings>System>Display>Advanced display settings>Display adapter properties then, click \"List All Models\" and choose the one you want. Keep trying different Hz settings. The video works in the booted OS, but not in the BIOS/UEFI This problem appears on Intel NUC, GA-H77-DS3H, and some other devices when using a CSI bridge. All you need to do is change the EDID data. This is the information about supported resolutions that the CSI bridge reports to your computer. Glitchy or wrong BIOS/UEFI resolution On some motherboards, the BIOS may be displayed at a lower resolution, or with some rendering issues/glitches, specially on newer ASUS ones. Like this: This can be solved by enabling the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in your BIOS, usually under the Boot options. If you can't or don't want to enable the CSM, you can try connecting a DisplayPort (DP) monitor, or a dummy plug . If you remove the DP cable/adapter the bug will reappear. If none of this works, try connecting the DP cable first, boot into the BIOS, disable the CSM and shutdown (do not restart) your PC. Then, boot into the BIOS and enable the CSM before shutting down your PC. Then connect the HDMI and turn your PC on again. There is no video in GRUB2, but there is before and after Sometimes this can be caused by the specifics of the BIOS/UEFI and how GRUB2 works with video. This can be solved by enabling the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in your BIOS, usually under the Boot options. The video mode will be located in the same section. Switch the Video mode from UEFI to Legacy . No image from computer with Linux + Awesome WM Sometimes Awesome WM on Linux can't recognize a video output change on a cable. That is, if the cable was first inserted into the monitor, and then you reconnected it to BLIKVM - it may happen that you will not see the image. It seems that the problem is Awesome WM, since for example with KDE, it is not reproducable. If you turn on your workstation with BLIKVM already connected, everything will work fine.","title":"Video Problems"},{"location":"faq/#usb-problems-keyboard-mouse-mass-storage-etc","text":"What speed is the USB OTG port? Per the official RPI documentation, this is a limitation of the SoC. The OTG port is only USB2.0, so is limited to 455 Mbit/s. Why can't some keyboard shortcuts of physical keyboards be captured while virtual keyboards can? For example, the F11 key on a Mac computer cannot be captured. This is because some shortcuts are already in use by the system, such as in macOS, where F11 is assigned to the \"Show Desktop\" function by default. When you press F11 in a web interface, the KeyboardEvent is first captured by the system, and if a callback is registered in the system, the event will not be passed to the application. To solve this issue, you can disable the system's assigned shortcut or use a virtual keyboard.","title":"USB Problems (keyboard, mouse, mass storage, etc)"},{"location":"faq/#hardware-problems-wi-fi-atx-etc","text":"If you use PiKVM software, the web UI show FAN error! Because the fan model used by BLIKVM hardware is different from that of PIKVM hardware, viewing the fan status through the web interface may fail in the latest system of pikvm. However, this will not affect the normal operation of BLIKVM fan. Therefore, when using the PIKVM image, as long as you ensure that the install script displays OK, it means that the update of the kvmd fan program is successful. The threshold temperature set by the default program is 60 degrees Celsius. When the CPU temperature is detected to exceed 60 degrees Celsius, the fan will start rotating at 85% speed. If you want to modify the threshold temperature and speed, you can modify the kvmd-fan.py script, and then re-execute install.sh. I can't connect to Wi-Fi at all! If your device is unable to connect to the Wi-Fi network that you have set up, check the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channel used by your Wi-Fi access point.

If you short them, CM4 will not start normally, but will enter the burning image mode. If your hardware version of boot has only two pins, use the jumper cap to connect the two pins as a short circuit. If you do not use the jumper cap or plug it into one pin, CM4 will start normally. If you use three boot pins of the hardware version, use the jumper cap to connect GND and another non-GND pin to indicate short circuit, and plug the jumper cap on the two GND pins or do not use it, CM4 will start normally.","title":"Hardware Problems (Wi-Fi, ATX, etc)"},{"location":"faq/#web-problems","text":"What ports does BliKVM OS occupy, and how should it be forwarded when using a public server?

Different versions have different usage methods. If you have some questions, Join our BLIKVM Discord Community for Support, FAQ & News! To use the kernel drivers, please update your system. There are a few things that have changed with the 5.4 kernel, so these instructions are for 5.4 or later. If uname -a reports anything less, then fix this before proceeding. pi@raspberrypi:~ $ uname -a Linux raspberrypi 5 .10.63-v7l+ #1459 SMP Wed Oct 6 16:41:57 BST 2021 armv7l GNU/Linux 1. Update & upgrade the Raspberry Pi system (It will take a long time depend on the different country) sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade 2. Enable camera module (the camera is enabled by default in Raspberry pi Bullseys OS) sudo raspi-config sudo reboot Navigate to \u2018Interfacing Options\u2019 and hit Enter. Now select the \u2018Camera\u2019 option, and hit the Enter key to enable it. Select \u201cFinish\u201d and select to reboot your Raspberry Pi. reboot is important!! Due to the absence of hardware encoding on the Pi5B, the software usage instructions for Pi platforms are currently divided into two sections: Pi5B configuration and configuration for other Pi platforms. In platforms such as Zero, Zero 2, Pi3B, Pi4B, etc., there is a reference for testing HDMI to CSI module demo. Edit /boot/config.txt (that will need sudo) sudo nano /boot/config.txt Add the line: dtoverlay=tc358743 Add the line if your shield support audio like C780 or C790. dtoverlay=tc358743-audio If (and only if) you have a device such as the C780 or C790 that supports the 22pin connector with all 4 lanes wired out, and are using a Compute Module with the CAM1 connector that also has all 4 lanes wired up, you can use: dtoverlay=tc358743,4lane=1 Check the amount of memory assigned to the CMA heap with \u201cdmesg | grep cma\u201d. The first line should be along the lines of: pi@raspberrypi:~ $ dmesg | grep cma [0.000000] cma: Reserved 256 MiB at 0x000000001ec00000 If it reports less than 96MB assigned to CMA, then edit /boot/cmdline.txt and add to the start of the line. Do NOT add any carriage returns. cma=96M Reboot. If all is well you should get a /dev/video0 device, and \u201cv4l2-ctl \u2013list-devices\u201d will tell you that it is provided by Unicam. After connecting all the cables, power on the Raspberry Pi, the C790 indicator light is normally green, and after opening the Raspberry Pi terminal, enter the following command: pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls /dev/video0 /dev/video0 pi@raspberrypi:~ $ v4l2-ctl --list-devices bcm2835-codec-decode (platform:bcm2835-codec): /dev/video10 /dev/video11 /dev/video12 /dev/video18 /dev/media1 bcm2835-isp (platform:bcm2835-isp): /dev/video13 /dev/video14 /dev/video15 /dev/video16 /dev/media0 unicam (platform:fe801000.csi): /dev/video0 /dev/video1 /dev/media2 This driver puts all the control in the hands of the user, or the user\u2019s application.

In the following test, the CAM1 channel is used, and the input resolution is 1080P24Hz. During the Raspberry Pi 5B test, it was found that the EDID settings were invalid, so an HDMI emulator needs to be added to force the target to output HDMI. Otherwise, the Raspberry Pi 5B may not receive any input. Due to the lack of corresponding hardware encoding on the Raspberry Pi 5B, the image capture performance of the Raspberry Pi 5B + C790 is generally inferior to that of the Raspberry Pi 4B.

Due to the absence of hardware encoding on the Pi5B, the software usage instructions for Pi platforms are currently divided into two sections: Pi5B configuration and configuration for other Pi platforms. In platforms such as Zero, Zero 2, Pi3B, Pi4B, etc., there is a reference for testing HDMI to CSI module demo.

In the following test, the CAM1 channel is used, and the input resolution is 1080P24Hz. During the Raspberry Pi 5B test, it was found that the EDID settings were invalid, so an HDMI emulator needs to be added to force the target to output HDMI. Otherwise, the Raspberry Pi 5B may not receive any input. Due to the lack of corresponding hardware encoding on the Raspberry Pi 5B, the image capture performance of the Raspberry Pi 5B + C790 is generally inferior to that of the Raspberry Pi 4B.

The following is a basic example, and for any specific settings or functionalities, please refer to the Tailscale documentation. BliKVM Installation First, make sure that your system has read-write access. If it's a read-only system, use the rw command to make it writable. Then, proceed with the Tailscale installation by running the following command: curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh Note that in some regions, such as China, downloading Tailscale directly might be problematic due to network restrictions.

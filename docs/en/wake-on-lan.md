# **Wake-on-LAN**

## **Introduction**
Wake-on-LAN, abbreviated as WOL or WoL, is a feature that allows a computer that is in sleep or shutdown state to be powered on remotely by KVM through a local network by sending a specific message. WoL requires support from the controlled computer; otherwise, the feature won't work. Additionally, it needs to be ensured that WoL is enabled and configured correctly. With this feature, you can power on the computer without needing to use the ATX function. If users encounter anomalies when using KVM's WoL, they can try testing it using software that supports WoL.

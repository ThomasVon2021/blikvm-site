# BLIKVM Overview

BLIKVM is an open-source KVM, it has four versions: v1 CM4, v2 PCIe, v3 HAT and the v4 Allwinner.
This device helps to manage servers or workstations remotely, regardless of the health of the operating system or whether one is installed. You can fix any problem, configure the BIOS, and even reinstall the OS using the virtual CD-ROM or Flash Drive. Unlike software-based remote management, you don't need to install any software on the controlled computer, providing non-intrusive control. Here you will find comprehensive information about all aspects of the operation of BLIKVM.

??? note "How to quickly choose the BliKVM model you need"
    * If you need remote access over the internet, since v4 does not support h264 mode, it is recommended to choose v1, v2, or v3; for local area network use, v4 is currently the most comprehensive and highly recommended;
    * If you want to install the KVM inside the chassis, you can choose the v2 PCIe version;
    * v1 and v2 are built on Raspberry Pi CM4, supporting a maximum input resolution of 1080P@60Hz, while v3 is built on Raspberry Pi 4B, supporting up to 1080P@50Hz. If your controlled PC only supports 1080P@60Hz input, then you cannot choose the v3 version;
    * If you have a Raspberry Pi 4B and your controlled computer can output 1080P@50Hz or below, then you can consider purchasing the v3 Hat;
